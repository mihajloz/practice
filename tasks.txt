OUTPUTS
Find the longest word in a string:
Input: "The quick brown fox"
Output: "quick"

Sum of the two largest numbers in an array:
Input: [5, 8, 2, 10, 3]
Output: 18 (sum of 10 and 8)

Check if a string is a palindrome:
Input: "racecar"
Output: true

Find common elements between two arrays:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5, 6]
Output: [3, 4]

Filter prime numbers from an array:
Input: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Output: [2, 3, 5, 7]

Find the missing number in a sorted array:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]
Output: 4

Calculate the average age from an array of objects:
Input: [{ name: "John", age: 25 }, { name: "Jane", age: 30 }, { name: "Mike", age: 20 }]
Output: 25 (average of 25, 30, and 20)

Find the most common character in a string:
Input: "Hello, world!"
Output: "l" (as "l" appears the most)

Get the top K largest numbers from an array:
Input: [10, 5, 8, 3, 2, 9], K = 3
Output: [10, 9, 8] (top 3 largest numbers)

Find the maximum sum of a subarray within an array:
Input: [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
Output: 6 (maximum sum of the subarray [4, -1, 2, 1])
